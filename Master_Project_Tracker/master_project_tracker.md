# Master Project Tracker

## 1. Ollama Systems Journal
**Purpose:**  
Structured workspace in VS Code for journaling, research, and simulation design using local AI (Ollama) — with a focus on systems thinking and real-world modeling.

**Current Status:**  
- Folder structure and VS Code setup in place.  
- Voice/audio features explored but **paused** to maintain focus.  
- Aromas Coffee identified as first real-world application for simulations.  

**Next Actions:**  
1. Finalize base folder structure:
   - `/simulations`
   - `/notes`
   - `/outputs`
2. Create simulation template (YAML + Markdown).  
3. Begin **Coffee System Simulation** (Aromas use case).  
4. Define analysis workflow (data input → AI processing → visual output).

## 2. Streamframe Project
**Purpose:**  
Experimental DSL + workflow for AI-assisted website and tool creation. Goal: unify best web dev practices into a **clear, component-based language**.

**Current Status:**  
- Concept outlined: readable syntax, declarative, AI-friendly.  
- Early documentation and brainstorming captured in VS Code + GitHub.  
- Secure coding practices planned for early integration.  

**Next Actions:**  
1. List **core components** (page, section, navigation, etc.).  
2. Define minimal syntax spec.  
3. Prototype parser for a simple example (e.g., one-page portfolio site).  
4. Start user guide with syntax examples + output screenshots.

## 3. Quantum Mug Product Line
**Purpose:**  
Creative-commercial product line combining glasswork/CNC skills with thematic storytelling and interactive design (QR, NFC, AI-generated art).

**Current Status:**  
- Conceptual — but aligned with your glassblowing and CNC engraving expertise.  
- Themes and stories could connect to art, science, or coffee culture.  

**Next Actions:**  
1. Choose 3–5 **theme concepts** (e.g., astronomy, historical voyages, coffee origins).  
2. Sketch prototype designs (hand-drawn or Affinity Designer).  
3. Research **production methods** (glass, CNC brass dies, printed designs).  
4. Plan **small-batch launch** (limited edition run + storytelling element).
