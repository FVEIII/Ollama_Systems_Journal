# 🔁 Feedback Loops: Central America Coffee System

This file catalogs key reinforcing and balancing loops that shape coffee sector dynamics in the Central American context.

---

## ♻️ R1 – Adaptive Learning Loop *(Reinforcing)*

- **Trigger**: Increased climate variability
- **Response**: Co-ops and farmers share localized adaptation strategies
- **Outcome**: Regional knowledge networks grow, improving future resilience

---

## ♻️ R2 – Certification & Market Access Loop *(Reinforcing)*

- **Trigger**: Investment in sustainable practices
- **Response**: Access to certified markets (e.g., Rainforest Alliance)
- **Outcome**: Incentivizes further investment in sustainable methods

---

## ⚖️ B1 – Risk Buffer Erosion Loop *(Balancing)*

- **Trigger**: Market volatility or price shocks
- **Response**: Farmers sell assets or reduce inputs
- **Outcome**: Lower yields → reduced income → worsened resilience

---

## ⚖️ B2 – Extension Support Loop *(Balancing)*

- **Trigger**: NGO or corporate extension service programs
- **Response**: Improved access to technical advice or weather forecasting
- **Outcome**: Reduces risk and prevents collapse in low-income periods

These loops are building blocks for:
- Scenario simulation,
- Intervention modeling,
- Agent interaction strategies.
