This stakeholder map anchors the sim's systemic structure. It identifies key actors and their influence across climate, market, and governance dimensions. It will be linked to:

* Feedback loops (e.g., farmer response to subsidies)
* Scenario levers (e.g., changes in ESG policies)
* Adaptation strategies (e.g., corporate investment in weather tech)

This structure improves traceability between journal prompts and simulation logic, making outputs easier to test and refine.
